Ingredients have a State (Raw, Chopped, Boiled) and a Quality (Terrible, Bad, OK, Good, Great)

Chef Actions always transition the state of the ingredient, as well as randomly possibly changing the quality from the
current quality. By no more than one level, I think. So doing well chopping and boiling Terrible Raw Carrots can only
get it to OK Boiled Carrots (with a stop at Bad Chopped Carrots).
